# Good And Bad Sperm Classification (Sperm Morphological Quality Analysis)

I am completed and exciting Deep Learning project focusing on classifying sperm quality using U-Net architecture
Sperm are tadpole-shaped microscopic male sex cells. In humans, when a sperm cell joins with (conception or fertilization) a female sex cell (ovum or egg cell), the fetal development process begins. This often happens after vaginal intercourse. But it can also occur through assisted reproductive technologies, such as in vitro fertilization (IVF).
People assigned male at birth (AMAB) start producing sperm around puberty— usually between 10 and 12 years old. But people AMAB can produce sperm throughout their lives.
Other names for sperm include:
•	Male reproductive cells.
•	Gametes.
•	Spermatozoa (Singular Spermatozoon).

##                                                              PROJECT OVERVIEW
•	Developed a custom data generator for loading and preprocessing images, enabling efficient handling of large datasets.
•	Built and fine-tuned a U-Net model for image segmentation to diffierentiate between ‘Good Sperm’ and ‘Bad Sperm’  samples.
•	Leveraged Tensorflow and Keras to design, Train and Validate the model on High-Resolution medical images.
•	Achieved impressive results with 100% validation Accuracy.
•	Analyzed the model’s performance using a Confusion Matrix and Classification Report to ensure reliable predictions and insights.
•	Tech Stach: Python, TenorFlow, Kears, OpenCV, Scikit-Learn.
